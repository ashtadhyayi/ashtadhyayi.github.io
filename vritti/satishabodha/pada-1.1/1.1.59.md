वृत्तिः -- द्वित्वनिमित्तेऽचि अच आदेशो न द्वित्वे कर्तव्ये। While reduplication is yet to be done, a substitution shall not be made in the place of a vowel on the basis of a vowel that is the cause for reduplication.

Note: This rule only temporarily stops the substitution until reduplication is done. Once reduplication is done, the substitution does takes place.

कृ + उस् = कृ कृ + उस् 6.1.8
