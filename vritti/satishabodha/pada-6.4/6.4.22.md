 असिद्धवदत्राभात्‌ 6.4.22 


वृत्तिः -- इत ऊर्ध्वमापादसमाप्तेराभीयम्, समानाश्रये तस्मिन्कर्तव्ये तदसिद्धम् । A आभीय-कार्यम् is any operation/rule that is prescribed in the section starting from this rule (6.4.22) up to the end of the भस्य-अधिकारः (ref. 6.4.129), that is up to the end of the Sixth Chapter. When one आभीय-कार्यम् is done based on a certain element, then it is considered असिद्धम् (as if it has not happened) in the view of another आभीय-कार्यम् which is based on the same element. 


Example continued from above. 


जहि । Now by 6.4.105 अतो हेः, the हि-प्रत्ययः should have taken elision. Since both 6.4.36 and 6.4.105 belong to the अधिकारः of 6.4.22 असिद्धवदत्राभात्‌, the ज-आदेश: that was done by 6.4.36 is not seen by 6.4.105. Only हन् is seen by 6.4.105 and therefore there is no elision of the हि-प्रत्ययः here and the form remains as जहि। 

Note: Both 6.4.36 and 6.4.105 prescribe an operation that involves the हि-प्रत्यय:। Since they are both based on a common element, 6.4.22 comes into effect.
