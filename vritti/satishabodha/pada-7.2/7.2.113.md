 हलि लोपः 7.2.113 


वृत्तिः -- अककारस्येदम इदो लोपः स्यादापि हलादौ। The “इद्” of “इदम्” that is without the ककारः takes लोपः, when the विभक्तिः affixes of the “आप्”-प्रत्याहारः, which begin with a consonant, follow. This rule is an अपवाद: (exception) to the prior rule 7.2.112. 

Only the दकारः of “इद्” would take लोपः by 1.1.52. But the following परिभाषा takes effect: 

नानर्थकेऽलोन्त्यविधिरनभ्यासविकारे। 

This means that the rule 1.1.52 अलोऽन्त्यस्य does not apply in the case of a term that is devoid of meaning, except in the case which involves modification of an अभ्यास:। 

In this example, the entire term “इदम्” has meaning but the “इद्” part doesn’t. So 1.1.52 does not apply when it comes to operating on the “इद्” part. Therefore, the “इद्” part completely takes लोपः by 7.2.113. 


Example under the next rule.
