 प्रथमयो: पूर्वसवर्ण: 6.1.102 


वृत्तिः -- अक: प्रथमाद्वितीययोरचि पूर्वसवर्णदीर्घ एकादेश: स्यात् । When an अक् letter is followed by a vowel (अच्) of the first (nominative) or second (accusative) case then for the two of them (अक् + अच्) there is a single substitute which is the elongated form of the first member (the अक् letter.) 


गीतासु उदाहरणम् – श्लोकः bg1-14 


स्थित + औ masculine nominative dual. Here the present rule would have applied to make a single substitute आ in place of (the ending) अ (of स्थित) and औ- but the next rule stops this operation.
