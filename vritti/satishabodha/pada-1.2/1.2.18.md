वृत्तिः -- सेट् क्त्वा किन्न स्यात् । The affix ‘क्त्वा’ when augmented by इट् is not to be considered as a कित् (marked by the letter ‘क्’)।


Example continued from 3.4.18


अलम् + रुदित्वा As per 1.2.18 the affix ‘इत्वा’ would not be considered a कित्। But 1.2.8 रुदविदमुषग्रहिस्वपिप्रच्छः संश्च makes the affix ‘इत्वा’ necessarily a कित् affix here. This also stops 1.2.26 which would have made the affix ‘क्त्वा’ optionally a कित् affix.

Hence 1.1.5 completely prohibits 7.3.86. ‘रुदित्वा’ gets the प्रातिपदिक-सञ्ज्ञा by 1.2.46 and the अव्यय-सञ्ज्ञा by 1.1.40.


We would normally form a compound (by 2.2.19) between अलम् + रुदित्वा, but the compounding is stopped by the नियम-सूत्रम् 2.2.20.


Example continued under 2.2.20
