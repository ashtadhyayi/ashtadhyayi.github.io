Of words denoting Princes (literally - who are Lords of जनपद) the base and affix meaning 'this is his object of veneration' are the same, in every respect, like those of a word denoting kingdom, provided that, the Prince-denoting words have, in the plural, the same form as the Kingdom-denoting words.
