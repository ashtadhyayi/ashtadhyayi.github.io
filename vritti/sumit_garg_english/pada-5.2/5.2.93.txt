The word इन्द्रियम् (having उदात्त (acute accent) on the last) is anomalous meaning 'an organ of sense' and so called either because it is 'the characteristic from which the existence of इन्द्र is inferred' or 'it is seen by इन्द्र ' or 'it is created by इन्द्र ' or it is wished by इन्द्र ' or 'it is given by इन्द्र '.
