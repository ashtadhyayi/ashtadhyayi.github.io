The affix क्यङ् in the sense of becoming what the thing previously was not, is used after the crude forms भृश् etc. which do not end with the affix च्वि -- अभूततद्भावे कृभ्वस्तियोगे सम्पद्यकर्तरि च्विः 5.4.50, and there is लोप (elision) of the final consonant of these words, if they end in a consonant.
