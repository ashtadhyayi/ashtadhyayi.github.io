A तद्धित affix ordained to come on account of the relation of the words being that of a द्विगु समास (Numeral Determinative Compound) is elided by लुक् when it has the sense of the various affixes taught antecedent to तेन दीव्यति खनति जयति जितम् 4.4.2 etc., but not so, the affix having the sense of a गोत्र (Patronymic).
